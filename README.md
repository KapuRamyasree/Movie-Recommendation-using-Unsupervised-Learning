## üìå Introduction

In today‚Äôs digital age, users are overwhelmed with the vast array of movie options available across various streaming platforms. As a result, deciding **what to watch next** has become increasingly challenging.

**Movie Recommendation Systems** offer a smart solution by helping users discover films tailored to their preferences. This project focuses on building a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** that suggests similar movies to a given title using various metadata features, such as:

- Genre  
- Overview  
- Cast  
- Crew  
- Keywords  

The system leverages similarity between movie attributes to make personalized recommendations ‚Äî without relying on user ratings or interaction history.
